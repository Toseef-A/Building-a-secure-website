# Building a secure website 

This project was completed as part of my bachelor's degree at University Academy 92 for the Cyber Security and Risk Management module. It focused on analysing real-world cyber security incidents, researching common exploits such as SQL Injection, DDoS, Phishing and Malware, and implementing defensive strategies. The practical portfolio involved simulating attacks in a safe environment and applying countermeasures, demonstrating knowledge of risk assessment, cyber threats, and mitigation frameworks in real-world contexts.
