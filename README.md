# Cyber Security and Risk Assessment Project  

This project was completed as part of my bachelor's degree at University Academy 92 for the Cyber Security and Risk Management module. The objective was to analyze real-world security incidents, study common exploits, and implement defensive strategies.  

The assignment included:  

- **Case Study Analysis**: Investigating a historic cyber attack, its vulnerabilities, impact, and recovery.  
- **Exploits Research**: Examining attacks such as SQL Injection, DDoS, Phishing, and Malware, alongside prevention methods.  
- **Practical Portfolio**: Simulating attacks in a safe environment and applying countermeasures to strengthen system security.  

The project aimed to demonstrate practical knowledge of risk assessment, cyber threats, and mitigation frameworks in real-world contexts.
